Secured Data Transmission in Cloud Using Hybrid Cryptography.

I worked with my professor, Devi T, to develop a new cryptography technique that enhances cloud infrastructure security. We published a paper in the "International Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics" 2018. Our approach employs a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms known as Hybrid Cryptographic methods to maximize security.
